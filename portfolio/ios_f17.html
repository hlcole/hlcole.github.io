    <h3>This project was completed by Cole and 2 other team members. The goal was to produce an application by working through the software lifecycle process. The app that was produced, "Guitar Chords," allows the user to look up lyrics and the corresponding guitar chords to popular songs. The user can then save the song for future use by adding the song to "Favorites." The user can also see artist information and play the original song through Apple Music. Another feature in the app allowed the user to record themselves and play back the saved audio file. The user could also keep up with current guitar news with the "News" tab, and they could also find nearby or online guitar stores via the "Stores" tab.</h3>
    <h3>Walkthrough and storyboard of the iOS application can be found <a class="link" href="./p_images/ios_walkthrough.pdf">here</a>.</h3>
