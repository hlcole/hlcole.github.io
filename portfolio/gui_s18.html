    <h3>This project was completed by Heather Cole. The goal was to produce a low-fidelity website design with a theme of family history. The website idea Cole created was a geneology website that focuses on the medical and biological side of things, rather than life events. This website was produced for users who want to know more about their bodies, what to expect as they age (based on family members' experiences), and predict what their children would be like (eye/hair color, risk of inheriting a family disease, etc.).</h3>
    <h3>This project was just started, so come back for updates throughout the semester.</h3>
    <h3>Low-fidelity website wireframes can be found <a class="link" href="./p_images/gui_design.pdf">here</a>. Wireframes created with Balsamiq.</h3>
